Monero Meetup Utrecht #5: How to protect your privacy when using cryptocurrencies
Hello magic mystery money friends!

The next Monero Meetup in Utrecht will be on Tuesday the 10th, and it's a special one!

I'm happy to report I found a speaker who knows what he's talking about and will give an actual presentation with slides. He's a regular visitor, a shadowy hacker, a Linux and Tor expert, and you may know him as /u/defterade.

We're also moving to a new location in the city center. Lisk Center Utrecht are our new hosts. Among other things, it's a co-working center for blockchain professionals. It's on the 6th floor of the Beatrix Theater building. Address: Jaarbeursplein 6, but the entrance is on Croeselaan. On the 6th floor, please click the buzzer for Lisk at the door for De Buren.

We're also changing the language from Dutch to English, but feel free to ask questions or make comments in Dutch. Last time, I forgot to mention here that my presentation was supposed to be in Dutch. After an Anglophone expat joined us, I talked in English, but others felt more comfortable responding in Dutch. Mixing both languages spontaneously went pretty well.


# Program
19:00 Welcome and drinks. The first round of drinks is provided for free by Cake Wallet, the Monero app for iOS.

19:15 Edwin den Boer tells what Monero developers and the community have been doing in the past two months. Notable developments so far: a new type of signature (CLSAG), audits of the new mining algorithm RandomX, the Monero Village at Defcon and the Monero Torch on Twitter. A network upgrade is being prepared for October.

19:30 Defterade gives a presentation that briefly introduces the Monero project, followed by an in depth look at privacy in cryptocurrencies. He will discuss Bitcoin's lack of privacy and how this has had real world impact. He will then discuss the the past, the present and the possible future of Monero's privacy technology and will give general recommendations to keep yourself safe when using Monero.

20:00 Break.

20:15 Second part of Defterade's presentation.

20:45 Drinks and more discussion. Meanwhile, try to solve a Monero puzzle with a 0.1 XMR prize - sponsored by Cake Wallet again.

I think we're supposed to leave around 21:30. We can stay as long as we like, let's say to 22:00. After the meetup, please leave the building through the side entrance on the south side, walking along the reception desk. There are restaurants across the road where you could have another drink.

Don't forget to RSVP, like, retweet or share a link to help us promote the meetup on those awful centralized websites:
